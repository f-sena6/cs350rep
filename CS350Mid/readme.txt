1. Purpose of My Application:

The purpose of my application is to simulate random encounters until I find a shiny Pokemon. Shiny Pokemon are just different colored variations of the same Pokemon. For example, the Pokemon, "Ralts," normally has a green head. However, the shiny version of Ralts has a blue head. Shiny Pokemon are extremely popular because of how rare they are.

Many years ago, I would play Pokemon for hours just trying to find shiny Pokemon. However, the odds of finding a shiny Pokemon are 1 in 8192. So each time you encounter a Pokemon in the game, there's a 1 in 8192 chance of finding a shiny Pokemon. Now, this doesn't mean you're guaranteed to find one shiny every 8192 encounters. It's a 1 in 8192 chance each encounter, so you can go 20,000 or 30,000 encounters without finding a shiny Pokemon. As you can tell, shiny Pokemon are extremely rare. Because each encounter can last around 20 seconds, searching for shiny Pokemon can be time consuming. In fact, many players of the game never encounter a shiny Pokemon in hundreds of hours of play.

I have always wondered, "How many enconters would it take for me to find a shiny Ralts?" So instead of playing the game for hours upon hours hoping to find a shiny Ralts, I thought I could create a program that would simulate this. This is the main pupose of my application. I used a while loop to simulate encounters until I found a shiny Ralts (or whichever pokemon you choose). I also appended the other shiny Pokemon my simulation found, and printed them out at the end. I took actual values from the game, and used them in my program. In the game, you can only catch Ralts in one certain area. In that area, there is a 4% chance of finding Ralts. There are also 5 other Pokemon to encounter in that area as well. So I took the actual encounter rates for each Pokemon, and used them in my program.


2. Libraries Used In My Application:
I used the Pillow Library, Random, and Sys.

So my application is probably not useful to most people. This applicaton is mainly for Pokemon fans. My best friend (who is a Pokemon fanatic) seemed to think my program was awesome!
